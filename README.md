# lotrpictionary

Pulls from a list of random lotr-related words (from tolkien gateway) for the purposes of pictionary. Characters, locations, and objects. The list is contained in all.txt. I would have used the random-page function on TG, but it returns stuff like "The 1985 J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar" which is obviously a little complicated for pictionary.
